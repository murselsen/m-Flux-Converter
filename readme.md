Scenario: Physical Unit Converter for International Travel

Scenario Description:
A user may want to convert units used in different countries when travelling internationally. For example, a person travelling to the United States may want to convert kilometres to miles or kilograms to pounds. This application allows the user to easily convert various physical units.

App Features:
User Interface:
An input field where the user can enter the value they want to convert.
A dropdown menu where the user can select the unit they want to convert.
Another dropdown menu where the user can select the target unit.
A button to start the conversion process.
A field to display the converted value.

Supported Units:
Length: Kilometre (km), Mile (mi), Metre (m), Centimetre (cm)
Weight Kilogram (kg), Pound (lb), Gram (g)
Temperature: Celsius (°C), Fahrenheit (°F), Kelvin (K)

Conversion Procedures:
Must include appropriate conversion formulae for each unit type. For example:
To convert kilometres to miles: 1 km = 0.621371 mi
To convert kilograms to pounds: 1 kg = 2.20462 lb
To convert Celsius to Fahrenheit: °F = (°C * 9/5) + 32

Step-by-Step Development Plan:

HTML Structure:
Add input field, dropdown menus and buttons.
Add a field to show the converted value.

Styling with CSS:
Aestheticise the user interface.

Adding Functionality with JavaScript:
Apply the correct conversion formula, taking the value the user enters and the units they select.
Show the converted value to the user.

Example User Flow:
The user opens the application and enters a value (for example, 10).
The user selects the unit they want to convert to (for example, Kilometre).
The user selects the target unit (for example, Miles).
The user clicks on the ‘Convert’ button.
The application converts the entered value and displays the result (for example, 6.21371 Miles).

This scenario and steps will guide you as you develop your physical unit converter application. Good work!
